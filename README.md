## Description

The Forex Super Robot AIB is an expert advisor (EA) that automatically trades the specified currency pair based on predefined settings. This EA uses the MetaTrader 5 platform and is written in MQL5.

## External Settings

- `currencyPair`: Specifies the currency pair to trade (default: 'EURUSD')
- `takeProfit`: Specifies the take profit value in pips (default: 50)
- `stopLoss`: Specifies the stop loss value in pips (default: 50)

## Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the EA is initialized. It attaches the robot to the specified currency pair and sets the initial take profit and stop loss values.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is deinitialized. It closes all open orders before deinitialization.

## Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the specified currency pair. It checks if there are any open orders. If there are, it closes all open orders. If there are no open orders, it executes multiple entries by placing buy orders with specific parameters.

## Close All Orders Function

The `CloseAllOrders()` function is called to close all open orders. It iterates through all open orders and closes each one.
